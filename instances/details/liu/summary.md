Snapshot: 21 September 2026. Repository research results; not a live MIPLIB leaderboard.

## Current result

- Cohort: original112
- Status: Accepted feasible; open
- Primal: 1082
- Dual / certificate: 1074
- Global conclusion: Not established
- Evidence: See the stated numerical tolerances and source audits.
- Project primal update vs MIPLIB v36: True (numeric_improvement)
- Dual improvement vs historical COPT 10h: True

Feasible; target-1,080 critical-path study closes two restricted neighborhoods, but global optimum remains open



## Evidence and provenance

[Instance evidence](https://github.com/Huangyc98/MIPLIB_openproblem/blob/b63b89634917ccde2f9e7dc7aefe1583a3eb55e8/instances/liu/README.md) · [Complete campaign ledger](https://github.com/Huangyc98/MIPLIB_openproblem/blob/b63b89634917ccde2f9e7dc7aefe1583a3eb55e8/results/catalogue.json)

The full campaign contains 132 instances: 112 original cases and 20 subsequent evaluation cases.
The subsequent cohort uses post-hoc best valid bounds from separate skill runs; numerical bounds
and independently certified bounds are distinct. Genus g31 closures accept residuals below 1e-10.

## Download scope

The downloadable research bundle is the unchanged 18 September archive. This summary and the current catalogue supersede its historical counts and genus policy.
